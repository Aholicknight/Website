  <h3>When are the 2019 camps?</h3>
  <p class="indent">This year we have two separate 5-day computer camps for you and your friends. As each camper gets an individual PC workstation, the camp is currently limited to 18 participants per week. Week One starts Monday, July 8 and finishes Friday, July 12, 2019. Week Two starts Monday, July 15 and finishes Friday, July 19, 2019.</p>
  <h3>Where do the camps take place?</h3>
  <p class="indent">The camp program takes place in the Engineering Building on the south east corner of the University of Regina Campus in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. Some of the camp activities such as bowling, swimming, Matrix Gaming, and a barbeque take place at other Regina locations but most of the day is in the computer lab. Campus maps are available on the University of Regina website.</p>
  <h3>Who should attend the camp?</h3>
  <p class="indent">The camp is designed for those who are age 12 to 17 (inclusive as of camp start dates), have a yearn to learn, the ability to think logically, thrive on challenge and group interaction, and have a technology interest that includes more than just playing video game. Any level of computing education is welcome, whether beginner or advanced.</p>
  <h3>What is the camp program?</h3>
  <p class="indent">Each day between 8:30 a.m. and 8:30 p.m. you’ll work on your projects as an individual and in small teams. Naturally there are biobreaks and activity breaks. Evenings include group technical, social, and recreational activities. Your camp fee covers all activites. Late morning or early afternoon activities (depending on the weather) include swimming and team games. Monday evenings offer bowling, Tuesday and Thursday evenings are for individual and team project work as well as for special guest presentations to small groups. Wednesday evenings are for competitive computer games. Friday afternoon is highlighted by a closing ceremony where campers get to show their creations to family and friends. In addition, the camps provide lasting benefits by enhancing your technical, creative, and communication skill sets. You return home better able to assist the advanced technological challenges and opportunities faced by your family, schools, and community groups.</p>
