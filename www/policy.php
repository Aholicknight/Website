<h1 class="title">Code of Conduct</h1>

<section class="faq-section">
  <p class="indent">TL;DR. Be respectful. Harassment and abuse are never tolerated. If you are in a situation at camp that makes you uncomfortable, if the event itself is creating an unsafe or inappropriate environment, or if interacting with an MSI representative or another camper makes you uncomfortable, please report it using the procedures included in this document.</p>
  <br />
  <p class="indent">Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic status, veteran status, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. If what youâ€™re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it. </p>
  <br />
  <p class="indent">Campers asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
  <br />
  <p class="indent">Sponsors, mentors, and anyone else at the camps are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.</p>
  <br />
  <p class="indent">If a participant engages in harassing behavior, MSI may take any action it deems appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no eligibility for reimbursement or refund of any type.</p>
  <br />
  <p class="indent">If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact MSI using the reporting procedures defined below. In emergencies, please call campus security at <strong>306-585-4999</strong> or 911 if appropriate.</p>
  <br />
  <p class="indent">We expect participants to follow these rules at all times.</p>
  <br />
